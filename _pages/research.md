My research fields are International, Spatial, Macroeconomics and Financial Regulation. 

I focus my research mainly on analyzing economic interactions over space, identifying and quantifying their driving forces, and deriving policy implications. I use both quantitative (international trade and macroeconomic) models and empirical (micro-econometrics and time series) methods.

Here is my <a href="/files/YANGPEI_cv__Copy_.pdf">CV</a>  and  <a href="/files/YANGPEI_RS.pdf">Research Statement</a>.
