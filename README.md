    I present the fact of China's trade decline and elaborate on some key mechanisms behind this phenomenon. To account for China's trade decline, I use a multi-sector, multi-region trade model that allows for inter-regional trade and inter-regional-sectoral labor mobility within China. The model features three main types of time-varying and region-sector-specific wedges: total factor productivity (TFP) wedges, trade cost wedges, and labor mobility wedges. I then calibrate these "wedges" and conduct counterfactual experiments to explain the change in China's trade share of GDP. I find that during the period 2000 to 2006, international trade cost decline (a 13.84 percentage point increase) and China's TFP growth (an 8.27 percentage point decrease) were the two dominant forces behind China's trade share of GDP increase. During the period 2006 to 2014, China's TFP growth (a 15.20 percentage point decrease) was the dominant force behind China's trade share of GDP decrease. At the sector level, the TFP increase in the heavy industry sector is the key to explaining China's trade share of GDP change. Through Input-Output linkages, services sector TFP change is also equally important, even though service trade per se accounts for only a small share of China's total trade.

    This research project takes advantage of high frequent consumer spending data as well as daily newspaper sentiment to investigate the impact of various consumer expectations on their spending behavior. The research design of this project consists of two parts: First, using a regression discontinuity method around the date of Pfizer's vaccine announcement to identify the impact of consumer expectation on actual spending during COVID-19. Second, implementing a VAR analysis to characterize the long-run dynamics of various consumer expectations (public health, income and unemployment) and changes in daily spending. Finally, we found empirical evidence that Pfrizer's95% efficacy rate of vaccine boosts all sectors' consumer spending by 3.2%. Grocery and food delivery sector's spending serves as the driving force of this increase. Secondly, the VAR analysis found public health sentiment is significant to life necessities related spending but insignificant to recreational spending. Most interestingly, the VAR results also provide the suggestive evidence on the heterogeneous responses of high vs. low-income group consumers. More precisely, we believe income sentiment is representative to high income consumers, while unemployment sentiment is more representative to low-income consumers.

    We want to know how Chinese banks response to different kinds of macro-prudential regulations, such as capital requirement, legal reserve requirement, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, liquidity requirement, risk exposure, and etc. How does the implementation of these policies affect the actual capital requirement, liquidity and risk exposure of banks? We extend the work from Shim (2010) and Jokipii and Milne (2011), and build a simultaneous equations model to examine the inter-relationship among banks' capital requirement, liquidity requirement and capital quality. We then extend the model from Bitar et al. (2018) and argue that banks' profitability, effciency and risk are determined by banks' capital structure, liquidity condition, capital quality, and other control variables that may affect these indicators. We estimate how the implementation of macroprudential policies affect banks' balance sheet, i.e. actual capital requirement, liquidity and risk exposure.

A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.

I think I've got things running smoothly and fixed some major bugs, but feel free to file issues or make pull requests if you want to improve the generic template / theme.

### Note: if you are using this repo and now get a notification about a security vulnerability, delete the Gemfile.lock file. 

# Instructions

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
1. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.

See more info at https://academicpages.github.io/

## To run locally (not on GitHub Pages, to serve on your own computer)

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above
1. Make sure you have ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs installed: `sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs`
1. Run `bundle clean` to clean up the directory (no need to run `--force`)
1. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll liveserve` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.

# Changelog -- bugfixes and enhancements

There is one logistical issue with a ready-to-fork template theme like academic pages that makes it a little tricky to get bug fixes and updates to the core theme. If you fork this repository, customize it, then pull again, you'll probably get merge conflicts. If you want to save your various .yml configuration files and markdown files, you can delete the repository and fork it again. Or you can manually patch. 

To support this, all changes to the underlying code appear as a closed issue with the tag 'code change' -- get the list [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aclosed%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22code%20change%22%20). Each issue thread includes a comment linking to the single commit or a diff across multiple commits, so those with forked repositories can easily identify what they need to patch.
